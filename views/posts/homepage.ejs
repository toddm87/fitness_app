<h1 class="has-text-primary has-text-centered">Just how perfect are the '<span class="has-text-danger has-text-weight-bold">PERFECT.pushups</span>' ? üßê</h1>
<p class="has-text-weight-semitbold has-text-centered">As most of you will know when it comes to working out <em>'everyone'</em> who benchs or curls a lot of weight is an <em>'expert'</em> on how to properly train chest.</p><br>
<p>But what about those who can't make it to the gym on '<span class="is-italic has-text-weight-light">chest days</span>' ? ü§î</p>
<p>I came across the <span class="has-text-danger has-text-weight-bold">PERFECT.pushups</span> one day in 2012 at a local park near my house. The concept of working on different muscles with very little movement fascinated me. The rotation on the device 360¬∫ '<span class="is-italic has-text-weight-light">wheel</span>' is very functional.</p> 
<p>So I wrote this blog to get people's perspective on the device.</p> 
<p>I want to hear from people who have experienced <span class="has-text-danger has-text-weight-bold">PERFECT.pushup</span>.. Even if you've never used them before but plan on using them in the near future.</p>
